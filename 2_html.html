        <td><a href="#" data-bind="click: $root.removeSeat">Remove</a></td> //Note that the $root. prefix causes Knockout to look for a removeSeat handler on your top-level viewmodel instead of on the SeatReservation instance being bound

<!-- 
The visible binding makes an element visible or invisible as your data changes (internally, it modifies the element's CSS display style). In this case, we choose to show the "total surcharge" information only if it's greater than zero.
You can use arbitrary JavaScript expressions inside declarative bindings. Here, we used  totalSurcharge() > 0 and totalSurcharge().toFixed(2). Internally, this actually defines a computed property to represent the output from that expression. It's just a very lightweight and convenient syntactical alternative.
