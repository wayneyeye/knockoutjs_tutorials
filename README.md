Good job!
This was a very basic example, but it did illustrate some of the key points of MVVM:
You've got a clean, object-oriented representation of your UI's data and behaviors (your viewmodel)
Separately, you've got a declarative representation of how it should be displayed visibly (your view)
You can implement arbitrarily sophisticated behaviors just by updating the viewmodel object. You don't have to worry about which DOM elements need to be changed/added/removed - the framework can take care of synchronizing things for you.
Subsequent tutorials will take you much deeper :)

Final niceties
Having followed the MVVM pattern and got an object-oriented representation of the UI's data and behaviors, you're in a great position to sprinkle on extra behaviors in a very natural and convenient way.
For example, if you're asked to display the total number of seats being reserved, you can implement that in just a single place, and you don't have to write any extra code to make the seat count update when you add or remove items.
